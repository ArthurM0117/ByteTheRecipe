Hello,

I am pleased to share the first version of our Overleaf project.

I'd like to address some challenges we've encountered with the documentation. Despite efforts, RÃ©mi and Toscane have not been able to contribute significantly to the project thus far.

Murad and Rufat have provided some assistance with the documentation, particularly with certain use cases in the initial project description. However, coordinating everyone's input has been challenging, especially given our varying levels of expertise. For instance, creating use case diagrams is a new skill for all of us, and I have attempted to understand and apply this concept as best as I can.

Edgar has been instrumental in the coding aspect of our project, and we are collaborating closely to ensure the overall success of our work.

Please note that this is only the initial version of the documentation. It may be somewhat delayed and incomplete, but I am committed to continuing its development and improvement.

Best regards,
Arthur Maurer
